# Hi Everyone! Welcome to Ravi Shah's GitHub Profile!

## About
Hi! I am Ravi, and I am someone looking for an adventure. I love studying complexity and using my mathematically wired mind to break down complex topics into simple understandable concepts. I am naturally someone who enjoys problem solving, and I seek out challenges to learn new things. 

I strive to push the limits in anything I do as my favorite quote is ‚ÄúPressure is a Privilege‚Äù - Billie Jean King.

I am also a very curious person. I strive to discover intersections between domains and typically apply computer science at that intersection. From designing pose detection AI models analyzing my tennis serve to training protein folding models, I am always learning something new. This is one of the reasons I enjoy competing in interdisciplinary competitions on Kaggle where I rank in the top 1% of competitors and became a Kaggle Grandmaster by becoming the 15th most upvoted user on the platform of over 10 million people. 

Fun Facts:
- I played varsity tennis
- I enjoy reading
- I have solved a Rubik Cube Blindfolded 

## What I'm Up To Now
- currently a Computer Science student at The University of Texas at Austin
- working on research at the intersection of molecular biology and deep learning (research papers in progress)
